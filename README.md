Financial Distress for Individuals

Given the definition of Financial Distress, while is certainly a well known parameter for companies, the challenge for you is to propose how you would go about building and model for Prediction of Financial Distress for Individuals, giving them a score and productising it via an API.

You don’t have to implement anything but requirements are as follows:

1. Create a public repo in Github where you add a README.md. Paste this assessment in the .md file and describe your solution, answer questions, add notebooks if needed, snippets, samples, references, links, etc.

2. Assuming you have access to banking data (transactions) and also from any other source: telco, personal data, etc. (including other digital platforms), identify features/parameters (not extensively but most important ones to consider) to be part of your proposed solution.

3. Which algorithm(s) would you propose.

4. How would you build and train your model.

5. How would you productise the predictive financial distress model in order to consume it and update it (real time) with more data.

6. Which part is the most challenging? (please answer in the README.md)

7. How do you think this is gonna impact people's lives? (please answer in the README.md)


While describing your solution you have to specify tech stack/tools used (and justify).


Please don’t spend too much time on this, it’s mostly informative and for you to research and propose an initial approach.
